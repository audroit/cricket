  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>Cricket Trump Card is a mobile game. We respect your privacy. This policy explains what data the app and its third-party services may process and why.</p>

  <h2>Data We Process</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Analytics & diagnostics (Firebase Analytics).</strong> Aggregated usage events (e.g., screens viewed, session counts), crash logs, and basic device data needed to improve stability and features. No precise location is collected.</li>
    <li><strong>Cloud features (Firebase Realtime Database / Authentication).</strong> Anonymous IDs may be used for multiplayer rooms and game sync. The app currently uses anonymous authentication; we do not ask you to enter personal information.</li>
    <li><strong>Advertising (Google AdMob).</strong> AdMob may collect device identifiers and show personalized or non-personalized ads depending on your settings and regional requirements.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To operate the game (e.g., multiplayer synchronization, basic telemetry).</li>
    <li>To analyze app performance and fix crashes.</li>
    <li>To display ads (if enabled in your region and settings).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Google Firebase (Analytics, Realtime Database, Authentication)</li>
    <li>Google AdMob (Advertising)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These providers process data under their own privacy terms. See:
    <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google Privacy Policy</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>The app is designed for users aged 13+ and does not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  <p>Diagnostic and analytics data are retained by our providers for periods necessary to provide their services and maintain app quality.</p>

  <h2>Your Choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can limit ad personalization via your device settings and Google settings.</li>
    <li>You may uninstall the app at any time to stop further data collection.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>We use reasonable safeguards and rely on trusted cloud providers; however, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

  <h2>Changes</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy as the app evolves. Material changes will be reflected by updating the date above.</p>
